Cat Herding Game Idea - guide cat through obstacle course using cat toys, ex. place box on slope, cat sees box and jumps into it sliding down slope, attract attention and draw in direction using feather wand thing. Multiplayer component could work, using offensive and defensive gadgets on same screen for multiple cats; drawbacks to idea include modeling/rigging (I could do 2D animations easier), making cat logic that isnâ€™t broken; pros for me include existing aesthetics to borrow from, many outlets for emergent gameplay
